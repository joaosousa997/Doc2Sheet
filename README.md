This code allows users to convert tables from a Microsoft Word document (.docx) to an Microsoft Excel document (.xlsx). 
The user can select an existing excel file to convert the tables to, or create a new excel file. 
Additionally, the code has been updated with input validation to check the file types of the selected files, ensuring that only Word and Excel files are selected before the conversion starts.
